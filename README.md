# Dispersion Calculator v2.4

Calculate guided wave dispersion diagrams for flat isotropic plates and multilayered anisotropic laminates.

## Description
The MATLAB-based Dispersion Calculator (DC) is an interactive software for calculating the phase velocity, energy velocity, and attenuation dispersion as well as mode shapes of guided waves in flat isotropic plates and multilayered anisotropic laminates. Fluid-loading and viscoelasticity can be considered. Polar dispersion diagrams can be calculated for anisotropic specimens. DC uses the Rayleigh-Lamb equations and the stiffness matrix method (SMM) developed by S. I. Rokhlin and L. Wang. DC is continuously improved and validated by using DISPERSE. DC was first released in 2018, and is used worldwide today. For more information, read [DispersionCalculator_Description.pdf](https://github.com/ArminHuber/Dispersion-Calculator/files/11271206/DispersionCalculator_Description.pdf) and [DispersionCalculator_Manual.pdf](https://github.com/ArminHuber/Dispersion-Calculator/files/11271208/DispersionCalculator_Manual.pdf)

## Usage

There are two ways of how to use the DC.
* Either execute DC_v[xy]_installer.exe to install the DC as a stand-alone (no MATLAB required).
* Or use the code (MATLAB and Curve Fitting Toolbox required).
